##Use Twitter Bootstrap in your WordPress plugins

This namespaced version of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is specifically for crafting
awesome, responsive UI for WordPress plugins. The toolkit gives you access to the 
entire Twitter Bootstrap package: base CSS, responsive scaffolding, buttons, tabs, forms, and javascript plugins,
so that you can design with the widest possible palette of flexible UI.

To use the toolkit with your plugin:

Copy the `css`, `js`, and `images` folders from our `bootstrap` folder into your plugin directory. 

Register the css and js files in your plugin `init` callback:

    wp_register_style('boostrap_css', plugins_url('css/bootstrap.css', __FILE__));
    wp_register_style('bootstrap_responsive_css', plugins_url('css/bootstrap-responsive.css', __FILE__));
    wp_register_script('bootstrap_js', plugins_url('js/bootstrap.js', __FILE__));

Then, enqueue these files any time your UI depends on them:

    wp_enqueue_style('bootstrap_css');
    wp_enqueue_style('boosttrap_responsive_css');
    wp_enqueue_script('bootstrap_js');

Wrap the UI you want to style with Twitter Bootstrap in a namespaced container, e.g.,

    <div class="wp_bootstrap">
      <!-- Twitter Bootstrap styles are applied here -->
    </div>

##How did we do this?

With the power of [less](http://lesscss.org/). Twitter Bootstrap makes use of less in its stylesheets. We simply prefixed Twitter's styles with `.wp_bootstrap`.

##Build bootstrap for WordPress

We have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.

+ **build** - `make`
Runs the LESS compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs pages. Requires lessc and uglify-js. 
[Read more in Twitter's docs](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#compiling).

+ **watch** - `make watch`
This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. 
Requires the Watchr gem.

##About the Developers

Twitter Bootstrap for WordPress was forged by [Joey Blake](http://github.com/joeyblake) 
for [Fat Panda](http://fatpandadev.com). But it wouldn't have been possible without the awesome
work by the Twitter guys who made [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
